# Milestone Project 1 

### Project Goal
The aim was to produce a website showcasing the services and social aspects of a bar and restaurant that had additional facilities for software developers, studients and anyone just needing a quieter place to relax. 

### Business Goals
The business needed to reach more potential customers and have a platform to inform them of upcoming events and past tournament results.

### Initial Design: Concept
The design concept was to focus on mobile devices first to enable potential customers to discover the bar and restaurant more easily. Modern trends show that the majority of searches for venues for places to eat or drink out are made primarily on a mobile phones.
In addition, the base design would attempt to show any potential new customers the fun and friendly atmosphere generated by the staff and regular customers, whilst also being informative of the services and activities on offer, but without overwhelming the website vistor with needless information.

### Initial Design: Wireframes

Balsamiq application was utilised to develop the design format and layout.

Being the first time I had used Balsamiq, I feel that I have not got the best out of the application to protray the design as well as I would have liked, but I am sure that in time with more practice I will be able to get more out of the application.


## Current Features
The current features in place within the website are as follows: 
* Responsive framework (to allow for different screen sizes).
* Responsive navbar.
* Carousel image galleries.
* Results table.
* Social media links.

## Future Features
Features under consideration to be implemented in the future are:
* Submission form (for restaurant bookings).
* Interactive map (to assist the customer in finding the business location).

## Technologies Used
The development of the project started out on the platform "codeanywhere", but unfortunately after countless issues and hours of work lost the decision was made to restart the coding process again from scratch with vscode. 
Vscode came with another set of issues, namely either being unable to preview the code or only being able to work on the code locally. These issues were eventually solved with the extensions; Git & GitHub Extension Pack, Live Preview, Git Extention Pack and GitHub Repositories.

In addition to HTML5 and CSS3, Bootstrap was also utilised, along with some minor style elements added with the help of Font Awesome and Google Fonts.
